Grand Challenges 2025

Workflow
- make the website
- incorporate AI to assist with reading such as sounding out words

Ideas
- AI skimming through the words and sounding them out
- user can click the word and AI shows the meaning, how to sound them out, etc. 
- Interactive settings that make the 'reading' fun.


Control 
- have the text
- user reads them
- user clicks of sentence or word that they don't understand
- screen pops up the definition of a word, pronunciation, etc.
- basic comprehension questions at the end after user fully understood the material.

Innovation 
- make the experience more interactive between AI and user by not making reading comprehension intense questions, but more of a checkoff for understanding larger picture
